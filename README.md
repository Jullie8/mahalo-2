# Mahalo
- Many teenage (~ages 12-18) women do not have access to information about contraception and periods, and may not have many web/mobile resources to get this information discreetly, as most apps on the market are focused towards older women who are more likely to be college educated and wanting to conceive.  
- Mahalo is a single-page web app that seeks to provide information to teenage women on pregnancy, contraception, and periods, so that they be more informed and empowered to take action appropriately.

## About
- Mahalo was built as part of the Access Labs Hackathon with the theme of health-tech. The team was inspired to create a women's-health related app that would fill a specific need. Contributors are:
